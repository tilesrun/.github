# Tilekit: A fast streaming compute engine for the multicore era.

At Tilekit our mission is to create a smarter and faster way of working with compute. We are doing so by making a cross-platform streaming compute engine that is designed for the multicore era. We are focused on introducing easier abstractions for developers to write high-performance code, based on automatic parallelization techniques. The engine is written in Rust and powered by WebAssembly, WebGPU, and WebTransport.

At present, as part of our exploratory research, we are openly conducting a series of [hacks](https://github.com/tilekit/hacks) and making [open source](https://github.com/tilekit/opensource) contributions to build the engine from the ground up with quality foundations. Our ambition is to design it as close to the machine as possible, with minimal external dependencies. This approach allows for full control of the ecosystem, including the API, memory, and execution.

A technical preview, serving as an experimental shell for testing compute kernels, is scheduled for Q1 2024.

# Seeking Collaboration
Contributions are very much welcomed even without large experience in WASM, WebGPU, or Rust. We hope that this project can be a sandbox for all of us to learn more about those technologies beyond this project's initial scope. 

Our design needs feedback from real-world applications. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at [hello@tilekit.dev](mailto://hello@tilekit.dev) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/jNaYqjgRsB). We're open to collaboration and ready to help.
