At present, as part of our exploratory research around single source kernels and automatic parallelization techniques, we are openly conducting a series of [hacks](https://github.com/tilekit/hacks) and making upstream [open source](https://github.com/tilekit/opensource) contributions to build on the vision of streaming compute engine from the ground up with quality foundations. The engine aims to provide real-time performance for compute-heavy workloads while abstracting away the complexity of writing such applications. We use Rust to build our software with WASM, WebGPU, and WebTransport.

A web shell for benchmarking compute kernels will be available in a technical preview in Q1 2024.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at [hello@tilekit.dev](mailto://hello@tilekit.dev) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/jNaYqjgRsB). We're open to collaboration and ready to help.
